WaterCraft
==========

This mod is about allowing the players of Minecraft to be able to do more with the current boat mechanic in vanilla Minecraft, so boats will be able to move on their own, to navigate from A to B and back again. To allow you to have more fun with the neglected side of Minecraft.
