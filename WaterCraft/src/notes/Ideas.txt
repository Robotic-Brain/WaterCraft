    - Boats
        - Chest Boat
        - Tank Boat
        - (Future Integration) Energy Storage Boat (Batbox/MFE/MFSU ect.)
        - EntityLiving Boat
        - Lava Boats?
            - Boats that are resistant to lava? So they can work in the nether.
        - Ice Crushing Boat
        - fishing boat 
        - Dumb boats!
            - these boats just follow the direction of the buoys
        - Smart Boats
            - these boats are smart and follow a path set by the controller, these boats ignore the buoy direction and just use them as waypoints,
              when it reaches a buoy it checks a list given to it from the dock and determines its path from that.  
    - Engines
        - Coal Engine
        - Maybe more in the future
        - Water Wheel Generator/Electric Engines (Ties in to a power System)
    - Power System
        - Furnace's
        - Engines
        - ETC
    - Power Gen
        - Steam
            - Run water though pipes that are above a heat source (fire/lava), this will turn the water into steam
              the steam will then have to be pipes to a vent block that will release the steam. The steam will come
              into contact with a turbine, turning it and so on.
    - Item and Liquid transfer
        - A cross between buildcraft pipes and RP2 (Require machine blocks, however don't have the logic) (RP2 is dead, has been since 1.4.7)
    - Power Transfer
        -RP2 Blue Alloy wire type (RP2 is dead, has been since 1.4.7)
    - Guidance
        - Boat Cranes, to raise and lower boats
        - Floodgate type thing, boat goes into the block and it fills up with water allowing the boat to increase/decrease its z axis.
    - Tug Rope/Linking boats together
        - Like carts in railcraft
    - More Fishing
	   - fish, better fishing rods, new enchantments
	   - automatic fishing poles that you stick next to water
    - Pirates (Can someone elaborate on this one?)
