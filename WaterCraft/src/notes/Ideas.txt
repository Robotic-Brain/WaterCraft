        - Steam
            - Run water though pipes that are above a heat source (fire/lava), this will turn the water into steam
              the steam will then have to be pipes to a vent block that will release the steam. The steam will come
              into contact with a turbine, turning it and so on.
    - Item and Liquid transfer
        - A cross between buildcraft pipes and RP2 (Require machine blocks, however don't have the logic) (RP2 is dead, has been since 1.4.7)

        -RP2 Blue Alloy wire type (RP2 is dead, has been since 1.4.7)

        - Buoy Controllers
        - Boat Cranes, to raise and lower boats
        - (alternative) Floodgate type thing, boat goes into the block and it fills up with water allowing the boat to increase/decrease its z axis.
